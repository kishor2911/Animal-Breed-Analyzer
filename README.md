# Animal-Breed-Analyzer
Animal-Breed-Analyzer is a deep learning project that identifies animal breeds from images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The system leverages computer vision techniques and TensorFlow to build, train, and evaluate an image classification model capable of accurately predicting breeds.

The project includes a complete ML pipeline: data collection, preprocessing, augmentation, model architecture design, training, evaluation, and inference. It demonstrates practical applications of CNNs in image recognition and serves as a valuable resource for learning and experimentation in deep learning.
